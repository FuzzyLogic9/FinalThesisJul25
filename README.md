# FinalThesisJul25

Hello World! Thank you for coming to the main codes used for my Thesis over the last 5 years.
Please note, I started before GPT help, so what take minutes now took me a few weeks and months.
I was also the only one in my department that was trying to do what i was trying to do so there was no real guidance, I went with stuff
that worked and got stuck loads too, and landed up where I ve landed up by what some people may call, sheer miracle!
There are no commits and pulls and pushes involved with my code.
Some in Java and some in Python. Patchwork of attempts to get me from point A to Z. And none of it was easy.
But in the end, i got there, the dragon was slayed and i slayed it myself, even if the cut wasnt clean.
And for that i am grateful and proud to own this chapter of my story and its ending.
I do not recommend using my code as i am very sure there will be better structure out there though.
Feel free to scope for ideas. And to s_it on them too. 
Cheers!
